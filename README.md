<!--
**kagraff/kagraff** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a full time student!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning programming (phython, R) in a reckless and haphazard manner
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with anything because I know nothing!
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about archiecture, urban planning, watercolor painting, or naval strategy
